## ☀ Project Overview
The ACES Project Fund Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the process of managing fund requests within an organization. The system is built with a focus on user-friendliness, security, and scalability, and is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing accounting or financial systems. 🖥 

## 🗝 Key Features
- User Management: The system supports registration and login for Administrators, Fund Requesters, and Approvers, each with different access levels and functionalities.
- Fund Request Handling: Fund Requesters can submit requests specifying the purpose, amount, and any supporting documents. These requests can then be approved or rejected by Approvers through a single or multilevel approval process.
- Review and Tracking: All users can review requests, add comments, and track the status of requests. Automated notifications are sent for pending approvals, incomplete requests, and when requests are approved or rejected.
- Budget Management: The system ensures that requests align with the available budget and allows limits to be set per user or department.
- Document Management: Users can attach and manage supporting documents for each fund request.
Reporting: The system can generate detailed reports on fund utilization, pending requests, and historical data.
- Integration with Accounting Systems: Approved requests can be synced with accounting or financial systems, and budget balances can be updated accordingly.
